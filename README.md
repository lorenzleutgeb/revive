# Revive

A hack on the topic of "augmented memory", resulting in a multi-person HoloLens experience.

**TL;DR:**

## Context

This hack came out of a [HoloLens Hackathon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk4mD43WTg) (48h), organized by [hyde.media](http://www.hyde.media/) at [Drei Austria](https://www.drei.at/) in September 2016.

## Idea

 * Timelines are being integrated into popular online products everywhere, but they do not convey the atmosphere of places where you usually revel in the past, such as:
   - At home, looking at an old photo album
   - Museum
   - Library
   - Memorials
   - Spiritual sites
   - Historical archives
 * Let's use AR to improve timeline-like features and render a personal archive experience that can be navigated naturally.

## Inspiration

Science Fiction:
 * Animus (Assassin's Creed)
 * Precogs (Minority Report)
 * Tree of Souls (Avatar)

## Implementation

 * Choose a collection of photos and assemble chronologically them in "towers" by topic, like old photos that have piled up.
 * Use the gaze feature of the HoloLens to dynamically hgihlight one item from the tower.
 * Combine this with a second HoloLens, so that two people can show each other their memories.
 * Unity 3D
